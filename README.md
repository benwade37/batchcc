Batch Cooking Collective

A tasty way to save the planet. 

Overview 

A fun food network with the serious goals of cutting food waste for single people (or anyone who cooks in batches). Finding someone to share good taste with. 

Problem

33% of all food is wasted. Some of this wastage is caused by single people who cook in batches to save money and time, but end up getting bored of the later portions. 

Purpose 

Good food shouldnâ€™t get repetitive and boring. It should be shared for something equally interesting. And saving the planet along the way is also pretty tasty. 

Target Audience

This is primarily aimed at eco-conscious single households, but any food lover can apply.  They are bored of eating the same stuff and want to share and taste new recipes and trade their food for something of equal value. 

This is also network. Disclaimers about food hygiene and safety will apply but it is not the responsibility of the Batch Cooking Collective. The logistics are too difficult otherwise. 

Project Board and User Stories
In line with Agile methodology, we wrote user stories in the planning and development of our website. The full details of these can be found on our project board.
